	 * non-modally only when the user takes a certain action.  An example would
	 * be a message appearing inside an error dialog box where the message is
	 * including in the list of translatable texts for the parent.  In that case
	 * no dynamic update is required because the user cannot translate text while
	 * the error dialog is open.  Just be sure to call this method each time the
	 * error dialog is opened (i.e. do not cache the returned String).
	 *
	 *NO NO, really this should be used only in cases where the user really
	 *doesn't care about translation, such as in log messages.
	 *
	 * In above scenario, must still be associated with a translation set.
